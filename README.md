## Introduction

Welcome to the New York Times Mongo Web Scraper created with Node Exprsss Servers and the Handlebars View Engine!
Users can data mine news articles from the New York Times to read the latest news without having to physically navigate
to their website. You can also add article notes to your favorite articles, sharing your opinions with the community!

### Check It Out!
You can view the project live <a href="#">HERE</a> (NOT YET DEPLOYED).

## How to Scrape Articles
Simply click on 'SCRAPE NEW ARTICLES!' in the upper left side of the navbar. You might have to wait a few
seconds while the scraper mines data from the NYT website.

## View Saves
If you click on the 'Saved Articles' link in the upper left hand side of the navbar, you can view all of
your favorite scraped articles.

## But... How do I SAVE Articles???
Good question - after you've scraped a few articles, just find the article you want to add to your saves
and click on 'SAVE ARTICLE'. It's a big green button on every article scraped, it's pretty obvious.

## Didn't You Say I Can Add 'Article Notes'? I Tried But It Doesn't Work!
I am working hard to get that piece working, but at the moment, this
feature has yet to be added to the scraper. Check back later for more
content updates!
